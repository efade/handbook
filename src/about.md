# This handbook
## About
This book is a compilation of tech-related stuff I consider important and somewhat hard to keep in
memory for ever. Also, part of this knowledge comes from trial and error, therefore it might be
useful for some folks around looking for specific solutions.

## How
This book is built with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/). You can check the source code
[here](https://github.com/gbrlsnchs/handbook).
