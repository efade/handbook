# Void Linux
Void is a stable rolling release, systemd-free Linux distribution with a powerful package manager
called XBPS. I use as the Linux distro for my main programming workstation. You can check more
information about Void on [the official website](https://voidlinux.org/).

## Why
The first thing some people ask is why use Void and not Ubuntu (for its supposed simplicity), or
even Arch (for rolling release).

Well, I use Void because I value _minimalism_ and _control_ over as much features of my machine it
is possible. Ubuntu is far from being minimalist and Arch abstracts too many functionalities to the
systemd suite.

## This chapter
Having my reasonings behind picking Void being clarified, take note that configuring and maintaining
it requires some effort, but at the end of the day it totally pays off because you end up learning
many aspects of the system and how Linux and other useful tools work in general.

Since such knowledge doesn't stick to the brain forever, this chapter is an ever-changing
compilation about everything I struggled through regarding Void, in order to help people that are
interested in using it.
